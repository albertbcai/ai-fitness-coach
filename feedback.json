I don\u2019t need to know that right like the context we already know that this is a workout suggestion, so it should be much briefer than that right it should look something like and it doesn\u2019t need to be exactly this. You know you can improve on this, but we can look something like maybe it\u2019s just like a few sentences for like the key goal of this workout like for an example it can be like last exercised one week ago Keagle hit a new PR. I don\u2019t know something like that right or it could be like last exercised three weeks ago Keagle maintain previous weight. Those are just examples and I want those to be backed up with scientific research, but does that make sense as a way to format it."

Let\u2019s get rid of that and let\u2019s just focus on the actual exercise themselves right so this suggestion dumbbell a bunch that\u2019s a good that\u2019s a good suggestion bicep curl. I did that a few days ago actually, I think what matters is like you should be able to know you should be able to suggest how many days ago I did each individual exercise right each individual exercise. We should make sure that we\u2019ve done at least you know that we\u2019ve it\u2019s been at least a few days and preferably we pick an exercise that I haven\u2019t done in a while."
